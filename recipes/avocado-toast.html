<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 slice from choice of bread (I prefer sourdough)</li>
    <li>1 half of an avocado per slice</li>
    <li>1 egg per slice</li>
    <li>Sprouts</li>
    <li>Everything seasoning</li>
    <li>1/4 Lemon slice (lemon/lime juice works too)</li>
    <li>1/2 tbsp per slice</li>
    <li> Salt, pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>For a fried or scrambled egg, warm oil in a small frying pan, pop toast into toaster as the pan warms up.</li>
    <li>Bread should be toasted till a bit firm.</li>
    <li>Add one egg to the warmed frying pan, cook to your liking. Try to keep the eggwhites or shape of the egg to the size of the bread you are working with.</li>
    <li>Once out of the toaster, butter the toast and add the sliced/cubed/smashed avocado to bread.</li>
    <li>If you want the ingredients to stick together, I would recommend using the Everything Seasoning, adding the spouts in a layer over the avocado and the egg on top of the sprouts.</li>
    <li>I personally like the spouts on top of my eggs.</li>
    <li>Salt, pepper and lemon avaocado toast to liking. </li>
</ol>
