<h2>Description</h2>
<p> This sweet spagetti sauce is easy to make and absolutely delicious. 
    Originating from my grandmothers kitchen, my father taught me how to make a spagetti sauce that will smell so good it brings any mouth to water. 
    This recipe will provide enough sauce for a family of 4-6 to enjoy for at least two dinners.
